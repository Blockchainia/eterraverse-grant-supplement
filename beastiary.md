### Description of the Ecosystem

This ecosystem is designed to represent a natural balance of interactions, inspired by both real-world food chains and the dynamics of RPG-style worlds. Each creature type plays a distinct role, ensuring interdependence and competition within the ecosystem.

---

#### **1. Saplings**  
- **Role**: Producers  
- **Description**: Saplings represent the base of the ecosystem, embodying plant life that supports all other creatures. They provide sustenance to insects, blobs, lizards, and opportunistic rogues.  
- **Interaction**: Preyed upon by insects, lizards, blobs, and occasionally birds.  

---

#### **2. Insects**  
- **Role**: Primary Consumers  
- **Description**: Insects feed on saplings and are themselves prey for birds, lizards, and rogues. They often serve as an important intermediate link in the ecosystem.  
- **Interaction**: Preyed upon by birds, lizards, and rogues. Compete with blobs for sapling resources.  

---

#### **3. Birds**  
- **Role**: Secondary Consumers  
- **Description**: Birds hunt insects and small blobs, playing the role of aerial predators. They sometimes scavenge on saplings and other smaller creatures.  
- **Interaction**: Prey on insects and small blobs. Threatened by larger predators like tigers and ghouls.  

---

#### **4. Lizards**  
- **Role**: Opportunistic Predators  
- **Description**: Lizards consume insects and saplings, but larger species may also attack small birds. Their dual diet allows them to adapt to various environments.  
- **Interaction**: Prey on insects, saplings, and small birds. Compete with blobs and rogues.  

---

#### **5. Blobs**  
- **Role**: Opportunistic Feeders  
- **Description**: Blobs are amorphous creatures that consume saplings, carrion, and occasionally insects. They are resilient and play a scavenger role, often competing with ghouls.  
- **Interaction**: Feed on saplings and carrion. Compete with insects, lizards, and rogues for resources.  

---

#### **6. Wolves**  
- **Role**: Predators  
- **Description**: Wolves are pack hunters that prey on birds, lizards, and occasionally rogues. They are fast and territorial, keeping the ecosystem in check by regulating prey populations.  
- **Interaction**: Prey on birds, lizards, and rogues. Compete with tigers and ghouls for dominance.  

---

#### **7. Tigers**  
- **Role**: Apex Land Predators  
- **Description**: Tigers dominate the terrestrial food chain, preying on wolves, birds, and blobs. Their solitary hunting style makes them efficient but highly territorial.  
- **Interaction**: Prey on wolves, birds, and blobs. Threatened only by ghouls and dragons.  

---

#### **8. Rogues**  
- **Role**: Opportunistic Predators and Scavengers  
- **Description**: Rogues are stealthy and adaptable humanoid creatures, capable of preying on weaker creatures like insects and saplings while scavenging resources.  
- **Interaction**: Prey on saplings and insects. Occasionally prey for wolves, tigers, and dragons.  

---

#### **9. Ghouls**  
- **Role**: Scavengers and Opportunistic Predators  
- **Description**: Ghouls primarily scavenge carrion but may hunt other creatures. They disrupt the ecosystem by competing with blobs and rogues, while sometimes preying on wolves and tigers.  
- **Interaction**: Feed on carrion, wolves, and tigers. Compete with blobs and rogues for resources. Threatened only by dragons.  

---

#### **10. Dragons**  
- **Role**: Apex Predators  
- **Description**: Dragons rule the ecosystem, preying on any other creatures they choose. They maintain balance by limiting the populations of ghouls, tigers, and blobs. Their size and power make them nearly invincible.  
- **Interaction**: Prey on all other creatures, including ghouls and tigers. Unchallenged by any other creature.  

---

### Summary of Interactions
- **Producers (Saplings)**: The base of the ecosystem, supporting herbivores and omnivores.  
- **Primary Consumers (Insects)**: Feed on producers and provide food for predators.  
- **Secondary Consumers (Birds, Lizards)**: Keep insect populations in check and form part of the prey base for larger predators.  
- **Opportunistic Feeders (Blobs, Rogues)**: Scavengers and occasional predators, filling niches and competing for resources.  
- **Predators (Wolves, Tigers, Ghouls)**: Control populations of secondary consumers and opportunistic feeders.  
- **Apex Predator (Dragons)**: Maintain the balance of the ecosystem by controlling top-level predators.  


### Statistics
During each mint, the player will roll a pair of dice. Depending on the number they get, they will have that many "slot pulls" to allow them to create a meta for their creature. The assignable statistics from this drawing with be Attack, Defense, and HP. on a scale from 1-15. 

Creatures can be levelled up by playing the game or assigning the creature to a server, where it will spawn every round in our FPS, or respond on a set interval in our RPG. 

Creatures can only be levelled up by ten units of each statistic, so to be able to achieve perfect stats, the creature must have a minimum of 5 for each statistic, or it will end with a suboptimal number.
